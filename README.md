<h1>Responsive Design</h1>
<p>Making a responsive web design is beneficial in case of different screen sizes of pc as well as mobile phones. I created this music website 
clone using different properties like: Size control, resize etc. in order to work make it work well over all type of devices.
Used HTML as a base language and added the css propreties to make the design fully responsive. The widgets used will automatically resize
according to the device screen size.</p>

<h1> Photoshop and Illustrator</h1>
<p>After creating the wireframes its the best practice to make a design look for the web page before starting the code. I'm attaching one of
my design images and the psd design file that I build using Illustrator.</p>
